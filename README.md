## Lab 7: CatCoin Crypto

# Description
This program represents a crypto account manager which uses proof of work to add blocks to the transaction ledger. Users can check the balance of a crypto wallet or transfer CatCoin between two wallets. 

# Testing Instructions
Ensure the wallets.csv and blocks.csv files are in the project directory and run catcoin.py. A miner_wallet.csv file will be created automatically when a transaction is completed.
