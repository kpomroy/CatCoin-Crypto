## Lab 7: CatCoin Crypto

# Description
This program represents a crypto account manager which uses proof of work to add blocks to the transaction ledger. Users can check the balance of a crypto wallet or transfer CatCoin between two wallets. 

# Testing Instructions
Ensure the wallets.csv and blocks.csv files are in the project directory and run catcoin.py. Navigate through the menu to either check wallet balances or transfer money from wallet to wallet. A miner_wallet.csv file will be created automatically when a transaction is completed. The blockchain ledger is displayed and updated automatically in blocks.csv when a transaction is completed.
